# Delaunay-Triangulation-Mesh-Generation

Research conducted by Dr. David Joiner, Kean University, and Sandeep Ramesh.
All research and code/projects belong to Kean University.

Using the theory of Delaunay Triangulation, created an algorithm in C# to analyze and visualize irregularly spaced data sets in the Unity Game Engine.

To run the model, please download the Unity Game Engine from https://store.unity.com/download-nuo and import these Asset Files into the environment.
